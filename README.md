## About

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve programming puzzles for each day of December leading up to Christmas.

## Usage

Code is written in Java and needs [Java jdk](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/download-and-install-java-development-kit-jdk-on-windows-mac-and-linux/) installed and ready to run.
Once Java jdk is setup navigate to the root folder of the project and open the terminal and run:

```terminal
javac Main.java
java Main [day] [problem]
```
